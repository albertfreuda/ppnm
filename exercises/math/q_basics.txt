What is compilation and linking? What is source code, object code and executable code?

	Source code: All the functions, typically contained in one or more .c files
	Object code: The source code is translated into the object code, to be read by the preprocesser. 
	Executable code: The ready program. It is a collection of all the object code

How can you compile and link a C-program which is wholly contained in one file, say hello.c? How do you run the resulting executable code?

In order to use the C mathematical functions, do you need to include any header files?

What is tgmath.h? It is a type-generic macro for math functions

If you use tgmath.h will you need to link any libraries? No, I tried.
